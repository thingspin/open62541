    * Return partially overlapping ranges

      Test the integrity of the range and compute the max index used for every
      dimension. The standard says in Part 4, Section 7.22:

      When reading a value, the indexes may not speify a range that is within
      the bounds of the array. The Server shall return a partial result if some
      elements exist within the range.
